# WinRemind

WinRemind is a simple reminder application designed for iPhones, but it also works with iPad and MacOS. It provides the simple capability to add new reminders, save them in a simple list, and mark them as done. I threw this together in an hour while experimenting with modal views, checkboxes and dates in SwiftUI, and perhaps may be expanded in the future.

The app is also compatible for iPad, but the padding on the bottom add button is lacking.

And it also works for Apple Silicon macOS devices with iPad compatibility. Same issue with the iPads.

To be fixed in the future:

* Edit and delete existing reminders.
* Fix iPad and macOS compatibility issues.
* Add notification support.
